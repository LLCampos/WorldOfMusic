				<p id="description">The music of Portugal includes many different styles and genres, as a result of its history. These can be broadly divided into classical 
				music, traditional/folk music and popular music and all of them have produced internationally successful acts, with the country seeing a 
				recent expansion in musical styles, especially in popular music. In traditional/folk music, fado has had a significant impact, with Amália 
				Rodrigues still the most recognizable Portuguese name in music, and with more recent acts, like Dulce Pontes and Mariza. The genre is one of 
				two Portuguese music traditions in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, with the other being Cante Alentejano. Regional folk music 
				remains popular too, having been updated and modernized in many cases, especially in the northeastern region of Trás-os-Montes. Some more 
				recent successful fado/folk-inspired acts include Madredeus and Deolinda, the later being part of a folk revival that has led to a newfound 
				interest in this type of music. In popular music, there is a significant number of popular genres. These include rock, with popular acts 
				including Xutos & Pontapés, The Gift (alternative rock), Fingertips (pop rock), Blasted Mechanism (experimental electro-rock) and Wraygunn 
				(rock, blues). Also hip-hop, with acts such as Da Weasel, Boss AC and Sam the Kid. Acts such as Moonspell (metal) and Buraka Som Sistema 
				(electro/kuduro/breakbeat) have had significant international success. Other popular modern genres in Portugal include dance, house, kizomba, 
				pimba, pop, reggae, ska and zouk.</p>
